**Abstract**\
We are concerned with the increase hate crime in the U.S. This is an important concern to address because no one should feel unsafe for who they are, regardless of race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or other factors. To address this concern, we plan to examine datasets from the FBI by state, exploring the locations, types of minorities affected by oppression, and other categories.\

**Keywords**: social justice; hate crime in the U.S.; oppression\

## Introduction

Briefly introduce your project. (About 150 words.)

We will be examining hate crime statistics retrieved from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). \

## Problem Domain

**Hate crime** is defined by the United States Department of Justice (2022) as "At the federal level, a crime motivated by bias against race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability". The occurences on hate crime have increased in recent years; 2020 had the highest record for reported hate crimes since 2008 (Arango, 2020). The Southern Poverty Law Center (2020) also mentions that"It's important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the FBI's annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country." TRAC Reports (2019) also gives us a broader view of the issue, with only 4 hate crimes filed for prosecution in 2019. \
The surge of reported hate crime rates, combined with the underlying issue of understated report counts, tells us that hate crimes might be an underestimated problem in the U.S.

#### Human Values

-   Hate crime offense records become an indicator of where the public awareness of **respect, empathy, and equity** stands. As a nation of diversity, the current stance on these values of the U.S. shows social issues and attitudes towards minoritized groups.

#### Direct and Indirect Stakeholders

-   **Direct Stakeholders**
    -   *Black People* are the majority of race-based hate crime victims every year; *Hispanic people* are also experiencing an increased number of hate crimes directed towards them. *People of Color* are directly affected by hate crimes, regarding their sense of security and well-being.

    -   \
-   **Indirect Stakeholders**
    -   *The U.S. federal government* examine changes in crime rates and make action, propose changes in the social system for their citizens to feel comfortable.

    -   *Journalists* play a role in

    -   *The global community* focuses on social issues and politics of the U.S. considering

## Research Questions

(grading rubric) \* Each of your research questions is presented in the form of a question\
\* Each research question seems tractable and answerable - and is concise and clear and free of jargon\
\* Each question is briefly discussed; you explain why the question is important and how it is connected to the problem domain\

## The Dataset

(grading rubric) *You use short sub-sections to describe your dataset\
* You include a table that summarizes your data set (data file name; purpose; number of observations; number of variables; citation, including URL)\
\* You describe how your dataset enables you to answer your research questions\
\* You describe the provenance of your dataset

(note by Jiyoon) might be good idea to introduce population demographic data / political party affiliation by state data / gun violence in america data / federal prosecution of hate crimes data\

## Expected Implications

(grading rubric) You list two expected implications - that is, findings from your investigation that might be help us understand the natural or built environments or might be used by other stakeholders (policymakers, designers, scientists, etc.)\
\* For each implication, you discuss the implication\

## Limitations

(grading rubric) \* You list two possible limitations\
\* You discuss each limitation and how you might address the limitation\
